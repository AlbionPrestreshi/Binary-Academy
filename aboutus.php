<pre>Binary Academy was founded in August 2011 by Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski. 
Sims dropped out of Columbia University to focus on launching a venture, 
and Bubinski graduated from Columbia in 2011. The company, headquartered 
in New York City, raised $2.5 million in Series A funding in October 2011 
and $10 million in Series B funding in June 2012. The latest round of funding
was led by Index Ventures.

On July 22, 2014, the site appeared with a new redesigned dashboard.[10]

In August 2015, Binary Academy partnered with the White House, working to host in-person meet-ups 
for 600 students from disadvantaged women and minority groups over a 
twelve-month period.

By August 2017, Binary Academy officially announced the launch of the new paid "Pro" product.
A "Pro Intensive" paid offering was also launched in August 
2017 but as of 2020 this product appears to no longer be offered.

In December 2021, Skillsoft announced that it would acquire Codecademy,
    for approximately $525 million in cash and stock. 
      The sale was closed on April 5, 2022.</pre>
